# Dashboard
This is a dashboard application built using Flutter. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to view and interact with key metrics and data.
# Approach
1. My approach in building dashboard was by designing the UI of the dashboard using Figma.
2. Updating users about the current real world data's.
# Challenges Faced
1. It was difficult in implementing the complex UI design .
2. It was challenge especially when it came to aligning and positioning widgets.
# Improvements needed
1. Will try to update the app with real time data's.
2. Adding a feature that allows users to customize the dashboard by adding or removing widgets.
3. Add more features like dark mode, night mode and light mode to improve user experience.
